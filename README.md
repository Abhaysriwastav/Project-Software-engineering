## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your_repository_url]
    cd stock_prediction
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The project requires the following libraries:

    ```
    Django==4.2.0
    numpy==1.24.3
    pandas==2.0.0
    scikit-learn==1.2.2
    tensorflow==2.12.0
    matplotlib==3.7.1
    seaborn==0.12.2
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or set environment variables directly on your system).
    *   Add the following variables (replace with your actual values):

        ```
        SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key]  # VERY IMPORTANT - CHANGE THIS! Generate a long, random string.
        DEBUG=True  # Or False in production
        DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3 # or your PostgreSQL URL (e.g., postgresql://user:password@host:port/database)
        ```

    *   **Security Note:** In production, *do not* store your secret key directly in `settings.py`. Set it as an environment variable.

5.  **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Load historical data:**

    *   Ensure the `top_companies_historical_data.csv` file is present in the `data/` directory in both the project root and the `stock_app` directory. (It appears to be duplicated).
    *   If the data needs to be loaded into the database (the provided code doesn't directly load it into models, but reads it into pandas DataFrames), you can use a Django management command or a data loading script within the `stock_app` directory.

## Methodology

The project employs a multi-faceted approach to stock price prediction, combining machine learning models with technical analysis techniques.  Here's a breakdown of the methodology:

1.  **Data Acquisition:**  Historical stock data is acquired from a CSV file (`top_companies_historical_data.csv`).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data is preprocessed using the `DataPreprocessor` class, which handles missing values and removes outliers.
3.  **Model Training:**
    *   If pre-trained models (`lstm_model.pkl`, `rf_model.pkl`) are available, they are loaded.
    *   Otherwise, the LSTM and Random Forest models are trained using the preprocessed historical data.  The models are saved after training.
4.  **Prediction:**  The trained models are used to predict future stock prices based on the current price, market cap, and sector.
5.  **Technical Analysis:** The `TrendAnalyzer` class is used to perform technical analysis, including calculating moving averages, detecting trends, and identifying support and resistance levels.
6.  **Visualization:**  The predicted prices and historical data are visualized using Chart.js.

## Dashboard Overview

The application provides two main dashboards:

1.  **Stock Prediction Dashboard:**

    *   **Input Section:** Allows users to input the company name, sector, market cap, and current price.

## Models

*   **LSTM Model (`lstm_model.py`):** A Long Short-Term Memory neural network model implemented using TensorFlow. Used for time series forecasting of stock prices. The LSTM model is constructed with the following:
    *   **Input:** The model takes sequences of stock data as input.
    *   **Layers:** It consists of LSTM layers, Batch Normalization, and Dropout to prevent overfitting.
    *   **Output:** Produces a prediction of the next stock price.
    *   **Training:** Adam optimizer is used to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual prices.
*   **Random Forest Model (`random_forest_model.py`):** An ensemble learning method based on decision trees, implemented using scikit-learn. Used for stock price prediction. The Random Forest is set up as follows:
    *   **Input:** Takes stock features (e.g., current price, market cap) as input.
    *   **Ensemble of Trees:** Consists of multiple decision trees.
    *   **Output:** Generates predictions by averaging the predictions of individual trees.
    *   **Training:** The model uses the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and stock prices.
*   **Base Model (`base_model.py`):** An abstract base class that defines the common interface (`train`, `predict`, `evaluate`) for the machine learning models.

## Future Scope

The project has several potential areas for future development:

*   **Integration of Real-Time Data:** Connect to a real-time stock data API to provide up-to-date predictions.
*   **Advanced Technical Indicators:** Incorporate more advanced technical indicators, such as MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci retracements.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate sentiment analysis of news articles and social media to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Portfolio Management:** Add features for users to manage their virtual stock portfolios.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the models and analysis based on their preferences.
*   **Enhanced Visualization:** Improve the user interface and data visualization with more interactive charts and graphs.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a production environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) to make it accessible to a wider audience.
*   **Model Improvements:** Improve the model by adding more hyperparameters and changing the algorithm.
